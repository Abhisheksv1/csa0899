Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list.

def find_second_largest(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two elements")

    first = second = float('-inf')

    for number in numbers:
        if number > first:
            second = first
            first = number
        elif number > second and number < first:
            second = number

    if second == float('-inf'):
        raise ValueError("No second largest number found (all elements might be the same)")
    
    return second

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [10, 20, 4, 45, 99, 99, 98]
    try:
        result = find_second_largest(numbers)
        print("The second largest number is:", result)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.

def remove_duplicates_with_set(numbers):
    return list(set(numbers))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [10, 20, 10, 30, 20, 40, 50, 40]
    unique_numbers = remove_duplicates_with_set(numbers)
    print("List with duplicates removed:", unique_numbers)


Write a Python program to count the number of occurrences of each element in a list.


from collections import Counter

def count_occurrences(numbers):
    return Counter(numbers)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [10, 20, 10, 30, 20, 40, 50, 40, 10]
    occurrences = count_occurrences(numbers)
    print("Occurrences of each element:", occurrences)
